# sure_evaluation

The evaluation of SuRE consists of three parts: (1) the evaluation of the rule genration algorithm based on 10 benchmark datasets; (2) a human-evaluation of whether novice can extract information correctly from the hierarchical rule visualization by an in-lab user study with 24 participants; (2) we evaluate the usefulness of the interactive workflow of SuRE by in-depth interviews with 7 domain experts.
